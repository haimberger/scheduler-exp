Icons
=====

Credit for the icons goes to [ZURB](https://zurb.com/). I downloaded the Foundation Icon Font archive from the [ZURB Playground](https://zurb.com/playground/foundation-icon-fonts-3) and extracted relevant images from the `svgs` directory.

The icon colour can be set by opening each SVG file in a text editor and adding `fill="#fff"` to the `<path>` tag.
